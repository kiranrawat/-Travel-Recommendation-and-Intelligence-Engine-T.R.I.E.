# Travel-Recommendation-and-Intelligence-Engine (T.R.I.E.)

# Overview 
Travelling is a highly emotional experience and has an endless choice of options that fit each budget and type of traveller. Solo travel, corporate trip or family vacation — travellers with different goals on their mind want the app to suggest the correct packages right from the start.
